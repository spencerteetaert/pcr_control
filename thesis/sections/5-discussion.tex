\subsection{Open Continuum Robotics}
With the rise in popularity of continuum robots, the Open Continuum Robotics project was created to reduce barriers to entry into the field \cite{open_cr}. The work of this thesis will be open sourced and aims to contribute to the Open CR project. Throughout the design process, keeping the robot easy to reproduce and repair influenced the design to enable third parties to recreate the setup. All parts are either off-the-shelf or 3D printed, with all firmware being open-source. This work helps bridge the gap between CRs and machine learning while removing barriers to access for other researchers to explore this problem.
