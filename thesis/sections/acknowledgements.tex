I would first like to thank Professor Burgner-Kahrs for the opportunity to pursue this research at CRL. This experience will be the foundation for my future academic work. Thank you to Reinhard Grassmann and Sven Lilge for guiding me through this project. They both provided a tremendous amount of help throughout the project both contributing to the work and guiding my goals in academia moving forward. Thank you to the one UTM shuttle bus driver who does not accept my ticket because "this school takes enough of your money". He really made my day during the weeks where it felt like nothing was working. Thank you to Callie Moore and Aidan Grenville, without whom I would have never made it through these last five years. Lastly, thank you to my dad. Though we disagree on many things, he has always been the one who encouraged me to be curious, to question why, and to figure things out for my own.
