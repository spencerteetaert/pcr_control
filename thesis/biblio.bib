ABSTRACT={Tendon actuation is one of the most prominent actuation principles for continuum robots. To date, a wide variety of modelling approaches has been derived to describe the deformations of tendon-driven continuum robots. Motivated by the need for a comprehensive overview of existing methodologies, this work summarizes and outlines state-of-the-art modelling approaches. In particular, the most relevant models are classified based on backbone representations and kinematic as well as static assumptions. Numerical case studies are conducted to compare the performance of representative modelling approaches from the current state-of-the-art, considering varying robot parameters and scenarios. The approaches show different performances in terms of accuracy and computation time. Guidelines for the selection of the most suitable approach for given designs of tendon-driven continuum robots and applications are deduced from these results.}

abstract = {The maintenance works (e.g. inspection, repair) of aero-engines while still attached on the airframes requires a desirable approach since this can significantly shorten both the time and cost of such interventions as the aerospace industry commonly operates based on the generic concept “power by the hour”. However, navigating and performing a multi-axis movement of an end-effector in a very constrained environment such as gas turbine engines is a challenging task. This paper reports on the development of a highly flexible slender (i.e. low diameter-to-length ratios) continuum robot of 25 degrees of freedom capable to uncoil from a drum to provide the feeding motion needed to navigate into crammed environments and then perform, with its last 6 DoF, complex trajectories with a camera equipped machining end-effector for allowing in-situ interventions at a low-pressure compressor of a gas turbine engine. This continuum robot is a compact system and presents a set of innovative mechatronics solutions such as: (i) twin commanding cables to minimise the number of actuators; (ii) twin compliant joints to enable large bending angles (±90°) arranged on a tapered structure (start from 40mm to 13mm at its end); (iii) feeding motion provided by a rotating drum for coiling/uncoiling the continuum robot; (iv) machining end-effector equipped with vision system. To be able to achieve the in-situ maintenance tasks, a set of innovative control algorithms to enable the navigation and end-effector path generation have been developed and implemented. Finally, the continuum robot has been tested both for navigation and movement of the end-effector against a specified target within a gas turbine engine mock-up proving that: (i) max. deviations in navigation from the desired path (1000mm length with bends between 45° and 90°) are ±10mm; (ii) max. errors in positioning the end-effector against a target situated at the end of navigation path is 1mm. Thus, this paper presents a compact continuum robot that could be considered as a step forward in providing aero-engine manufacturers with a solution to perform complex tasks in an invasive manner.}

abstract = {Abstract Background Accurate motion control of flexible surgical manipulators is crucial in tissue manipulation tasks. The tendon-driven serpentine manipulator (TSM) is one of the most widely adopted flexible mechanisms in minimally invasive surgery because of its enhanced maneuverability in torturous environments. TSM, however, exhibits high nonlinearities and conventional analytical kinematics model is insufficient to achieve high accuracy. Methods To account for the system nonlinearities, we applied a data driven approach to encode the system inverse kinematics. Three regression methods: extreme learning machine (ELM), Gaussian mixture regression (GMR) and K-nearest neighbors regression (KNNR) were implemented to learn a nonlinear mapping from the robot 3D position states to the control inputs. Results The performance of the three algorithms was evaluated both in simulation and physical trajectory tracking experiments. KNNR performed the best in the tracking experiments, with the lowest RMSE of 2.1275 mm. Conclusions The proposed inverse kinematics learning methods provide an alternative and efficient way to accurately model the tendon driven flexible manipulator.},

abstract = {In this paper we introduce the first robust control for continuum robots that are modelled by Cosserat Rod theory. Constituted from deformable elastic backbones, continuum robots are highly nonlinear and complex. Current control approaches tend to overcome this obstacle by adopting assumptions to the robot’s structure aiming to develop models that are both accurate and applicable for real time control applications. The drawback of such approaches is that maintaining those modelling assumptions restricts the robots expected performance. Here, we overcome the drawbacks by utilizing a dynamic model based on Cosserat Rod that is free from those assumptions and capable of accommodating the backbone general deformations. This general model has not been used in robust control design before as it is computationally expensive to simulate and be used for real time control applications. In this paper, we solved the expensive computation problem by employing a sophisticated numerical method known as the Generalized-α method. For the control part, a robust controller is designed based on sliding mode. To avoid drastic changes in the actuating tension, control input saturation is considered in the design process. Simulation examples are included to verify the effectiveness of the proposed design.}

The rod, which is assumed to undergo flexure about two principal axes, extension, shear and torsion, are described by a general geometrically exact theory. Based on the Cosserat theory, a set of governing partial differential equations of motion with arbitrary boundary conditions is formulated in terms of the displacements and angular variables, thus the dynamical analysis of elastic rods can be carried out rather simply. The case of doubly symmetric cross-section of the rod is considered and the Kirchoff constitutive relations are adopted to provide an adequate description of elastic properties in terms of a few elastic moduli. A cantilever is given as a simple example to demonstrate the use of the formulation developed. The nonlinear dynamic model with the corresponding boundary and initial conditions are numerically solved using the Femlab/Matlab software packages. The corresponding nonlinear dynamical responses of the cantilever under external harmonic excitations are presented through numerical simulations.}

A flexible snake-like arm which can take ideally any shape in the three dimensions will necessarily consist of many elements which can move with respect to each other. In order to control the shape of such a device, each element needs an actuator and a sensor. The weight, therefore, becomes a problem of primary importance. This design is based on the manipulation of each element by controlling the lengths of three strings attached to each unit, and kept in tension, from a central drive unit. Each element is of light weight and the weight of the control devices is also taken out from the manipulator arm. The paper discusses the applicability of this design.}

ABSTRACT={Soft continuum robots have been accepted as a promising category of biomedical robots, accredited to the robots’ inherent compliance that makes them safely interact with their surroundings. In its application of minimally invasive surgery, such a continuum concept shares the same view of robotization for conventional endoscopy/laparoscopy. Different from rigid-link robots with accurate analytical kinematics/dynamics, soft robots encounter modeling uncertainties due to intrinsic and extrinsic factors, which would deteriorate the model-based control performances. However, the trade-off between flexibility and controllability of soft manipulators may not be readily optimized but would be demanded for specific kinds of modeling approaches. To this end, data-driven modeling strategies making use of machine learning algorithms would be an encouraging way out for the control of soft continuum robots. In this article, we attempt to overview the current state of kinematic/dynamic model-free control schemes for continuum manipulators, particularly by learning-based means, and discuss their similarities and differences. Perspectives and trends in the development of new control methods are also investigated through the review of existing limitations and challenges.}

After decades of pioneering research, many innovative structural design and actuation methods have arisen. Untethered magnetic robots are a good example; its external actuation characteristic allows for miniaturization, and they have gotten a lot of interest from academics. Furthermore, continuum robots with proprioceptive abilities are also studied. In modeling, modeling approaches based on continuum mechanics and geometric shaping hypothesis have made significant progress after years of research. Geometric exact continuum mechanics yields apparent computing efficiency via discrete modeling when combined with numerical analytic methods such that many effective model-based control methods have been realized. In the control, closed-loop and hybrid control methods offer great accuracy and resilience of motion control when combined with sensor feedback information. On the other hand, the advancement of machine learning has made modeling and control of continuum robots easier. The data-driven modeling technique simplifies modeling and improves anti-interference and generalization abilities. This paper discusses the current development and challenges of continuum robots in the above fields and provides prospects for the future.}}

ABSTRACT = {State estimation is widely used in various automated systems, including IoT systems, unmanned systems, robots, etc. In traditional state estimation, measurement data are instantaneous and processed in real time. With modern systems’ development, sensors can obtain more and more signals and store them. Therefore, how to use these measurement big data to improve the performance of state estimation has become a hot research issue in this field. This paper reviews the development of state estimation and future development trends. First, we review the model-based state estimation methods, including the Kalman filter, such as the extended Kalman filter (EKF), unscented Kalman filter (UKF), cubature Kalman filter (CKF), etc. Particle filters and Gaussian mixture filters that can handle mixed Gaussian noise are discussed, too. These methods have high requirements for models, while it is not easy to obtain accurate system models in practice. The emergence of robust filters, the interacting multiple model (IMM), and adaptive filters are also mentioned here. Secondly, the current research status of data-driven state estimation methods is introduced based on network learning. Finally, the main research results for hybrid filters obtained in recent years are summarized and discussed, which combine model-based methods and data-driven methods. This paper is based on state estimation research results and provides a more detailed overview of model-driven, data-driven, and hybrid-driven approaches. The main algorithm of each method is provided so that beginners can have a clearer understanding. Additionally, it discusses the future development trends for researchers in state estimation.},

    abstract = { Recent successes in the field of machine learning, as well as the availability of increased sensing and computational capabilities in modern control systems, have led to a growing interest in learning and data-driven control techniques. Model predictive control (MPC), as the prime methodology for constrained control, offers a significant opportunity to exploit the abundance of data in a reliable manner, particularly while taking safety constraints into account. This review aims at summarizing and categorizing previous research on learning-based MPC, i.e., the integration or combination of MPC with learning methods, for which we consider three main categories. Most of the research addresses learning for automatic improvement of the prediction model from recorded data. There is, however, also an increasing interest in techniques to infer the parameterization of the MPC controller, i.e., the cost and constraints, that lead to the best closed-loop performance. Finally, we discuss concepts that leverage MPC to augment learning-based controllers with constraint satisfaction properties. }

abstract = {This paper proposes two solutions for the inverse kinematic problem of an industrial parallel robot: a closed analytical form and a Deep Learning approximation model based on three different networks. The analytical form is found and compared against the three Neural Network models: MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron), deep LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory) and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) networks. Algorithms based on these three machine learning (ML) techniques were implemented in a tensorflow environment, using a Deep Learning server machine. Analysis of inverse kinematics is complex and in most cases it pursues multiple solutions; furthermore, an analytic solution exists only for an ideal robot model when the structure of the robot meets certain conditions. Therefore, soft-computing alternatives, along with the Deep Learning concept are qualified candidates due to decreased calculation and processing times compared with other conventional methods. The solution proposed here includes a prediction accuracy comparison between three ML techniques, as well as the validation with the nominal kinematic model of the parallel industrial robot. It is a novel alternative for solving and validating parallel robot models.}
